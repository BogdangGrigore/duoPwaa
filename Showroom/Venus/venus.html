      <h2>Info about the painting</h2>
      <p>
        There are over 35 self-portraits by Vincent but just one portrait photo
        of him Only one portrait photo of Vincent has survived. It shows him at
        the age of 19 with a slightly gruff expression. Almost everything else
        we know about his appearance comes from the many self-portraits he
        painted. No fewer than 35 of them are known. They tell us that he had
        red hair, green eyes and an angular face. Yet each of those faces is
        different. Vincent himself wrote: ‘People say – and I’m quite willing to
        believe it – that it’s difficult to know oneself – but it’s not easy to
        paint oneself either.
